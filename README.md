# markdownsharp
Modified version of MarkdownSharp for C# with some minor additions:

- Added a strikethrough regex converted to `<del>` HTML tag
- Modified to detect hashtags from headers (headers should be with space before the text while hashtags shoudn't + hashtags don't have spaces)

See LICENSE for details.
